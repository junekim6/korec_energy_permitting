    "## Final steps\n",
    "1. Finalize your **properties dataframe**: properties.name, properties.headline, properties.article, properties.color, (properties.radius (for points)) -- [Instead of creating colors you can specify a range and use the **properties.rating** property, see below]\n",
    "    See the Mapbox_Tutorial.ipynb for more details on each of these properties\n",
    "2. Obtain and prep your **geometry dataframe**: **geometry.type\tand geometry.coordinates**\n",
    "3. THIS IS EVERYTHING!!! Join those two data frames and **export to geojson--specifically to geo-data.js** and put that file in the map template folder.\n",
    "4. Open up the template's file **map.html** in Chrome with the JavaScript console open and make sure that it works. \n",
    "5. Customize mapbox:\n",
    "\n",
    "\ta. set the center lng/lat and zoom (if the auto center/zoom isn't great)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tb. change the title\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tc. change the background tiles (if you feel like it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are done!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional extensions:** don't do these until you have gotten through the final steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups:** you can have multiple layers on your map that can be toggled with the select bar. There're two ways groups can work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can show everything at first, and then only display specific areas of that map: see the leaflet tutorial ipynb for districts grouped by appellate court district.\n",
    "2. they can show completely different layers: for example, in the case at the BBC countries by critic and then countries by director\n",
    "\t\n",
    "If you want to have multiple groups, please contact me with your plan. The main thing is adding both group_id and group_name columns to your table. group_id must begin with the number 0 and go up incrementally from there: 1, 2, 3... so they can be displayed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Legend/Paint/rating:** feel free to erase the HTML/JavaScript that displays the current legend. If you want to try to build a legend in HTML give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "This legend from the template shows of background color for a range of values between 1 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div id='color-scale'>\n",
    "    <p>Rating</p>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the JavaScript it dynamically colors all of your shapes based on the range of ratings. Note the parallels between the colors:\n",

    "\t'interpolate', ['linear'],\n",

    "1. Reduce your data frames to geographic units and group (see BBC example below)\n",
    "2. Create your properties: properties.name, properties.headline\n",
    "3. properties.article: This is the most challenging one. You can potentially have the entire full-length articles here or many grouped/aggregated rows. It should contain HTML so that it will be laid out properly in the browser.\n",

You don't call the nine Park Service employees at Harpers Ferry and ask them to come out and fix the tree. Respondents' theory is inconsistent with the Act and would dramatically change the national trail system. Respondents, for instance, argue that the trail is land and it's administered by the Park Service. So their position is that the entire trail is federally administered -- a federally administered area of land. But if you look at page 14a, this is Section 1246(h)(1), it requires that the Secretary shall encourage states to operate, develop, and maintain portions of such trails -and this is scenic trails -- located outside the boundaries of federally-administrated areas.

First, as a matter of text, multiple provisions of the Trails Act draw a distinction between the trail and the land it traverses and   makes clear that administrative authority is granted only over the former and leaves the latter jurisdiction over the lands themselves undisturbed. Moreover, the Trails Act itself makes clear that the trail can be moved. It makes sense for a trail or a trail route to move every time a tree falls. It doesn't make sense for the status of lands to change every time the route moves. The context powerfully reinforces this key distinction. If you want to see a model of a statute that transfers land between federal agencies and makes the land subject to the Organic Act, you need look no further than the Rivers Act passed the same day by the same Congress. The reason, though, when it did that in the Rivers Act it did exactly what you'd expect it to do when it transfers land, it talked about the width of the land transferred, the acreage involved and then left no doubt that if the land was transferred to the Park Service, it became subject to the Organic Act.

That's -- that's sort of a subsidiary provision that says how you deal with pipeline rights-of-way when you have two agencies with jurisdiction over the surface. And it uses that formulation, but when it's really trying to figure out what's the right agency head, it asks which agency head has jurisdiction over the lands. And I think that that -- it doesn't say surface in that provision. provision. But with one more word about sort of the theory we've actually articulated, I do think if you look at all of these trails, you'll see why Congress picked a different term. And I And I think that's the critical think it's important to know, it's not like we don't have a term in the statute for the trails. They are components in the national trail system. And that's what Congress called them   that. And they called them that on the same day they passed the Rivers Act, where they actually talked about transferring jurisdiction, they talked about acreage. There's a separate section of the Rivers Act, section 1280, that talks about the interaction of the Rivers Act and the Mineral Leasing Act. All of that was necessary because Congress knew what it was doing and it was transferring land and making new lands in the National Park System subject to the Organic Act. It said it in haec verba. It was doing no such thing in the Trails Act. Congress isn't crazy. They were creating tens of thousands of miles of trails, most of which would be administered by the Park Service. They were under no delusion that they were, like, quadrupling -- I don't know, probably 40 times increasing the size of the lands in the National Park System. If you look at those two maps at the back of our reply brief, you can see the difference in the implications of the theories. It's very modest to look at the second map, which shows you sort of what I would have called   before I got involved in this case the true National Park System. pipeline around that. If you look at the national trails system, it would be a huge barrier to pipeline development. And if you're ever going to apply Easy enough to steer a the elephants-in-the-mouse-hole-type approach to a statute, this is one where it really calls out -- especially if you think about the Trails Act, it's got those wonderful quaint provisions that are getting into the details of whether the Park Service or the Forest Service or the private landowners are the ones that should blaze the trail. A statute that addresses those kind of details in that kind of granular specificity should not be interpreted to have these transformative effects sub silentio. And don't forget -- I mean, I know you said it's -- well, there is that Pacific Crest Trail, there's also the Continental Divide Trail, there's also the Pacific Northwest Trail, who are all administered by the Forest Service. \"},\n",

So \"under\" counts, as Justice Kagan pointed out, the Mineral Leasing Act itself talks about who has jurisdiction over the surface lands. Obviously the pipeline is going to go under those lands, but it\\'s the one who administers the surface of the lands. And we know that the Park Service administer these lands because Congress made that very clear in the three interlocking statutes at issue here. The Trails Act in 1968 says, without any equivocation, the Appalachian Trail shall be   administered by the Secretary of the Interior who has delegated that to the Park Service. The General Authorities Act two years later said all areas administered by the Park Service, without limitation, are part of one National Park System. If it\\'s administered by the Park Service, it is an area of land or water. Whether it\\'s a historic building, whether it\\'s a monument, whether it\\'s a parkway, or whether it\\'s a trail, it is -- if it\\'s administered, it counts as an area of land, which the Court in the Sturgeon case pointed out it\\'s up to Congress to decide how broadly to use the term \"land\" in a statute.
